        <p>For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible. I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If you’ve cloned/downloaded the code example repository, it should be in the ‘examples/Lecture25’ folder. Copy the contents of ‘examples/Lecture25’ to your solution container folder (e.g., ‘module3-solution’) as a starting point..Since we are using Bootstrap for this assignment, instead of specifying pixel ranges, I will define our desktop, tablet, and mobile views in terms of Bootstrap CSS class prefixes, i.e., ‘md’, ‘sm’, and ‘xs’.Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘md’-based classesTablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘sm’-based classesMobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap ‘xs’-based classesNavbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page, i.e., the default one that does not stay in the same place when the page scrolls. The navbar should have a company name (i.e., ‘navbar-brand’ class) called “Food, LLC” that is aligned to the left side of the navbar. (See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar. Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button appear in the first example shown at the provided link.)
